# Social Media App

Hello! ðŸ˜Š
I followed a tutorial from the official redux website about the basics of React + Redux. You can access the website [here](https://redux.js.org/tutorials/essentials/part-1-overview-concepts).

## What does the Social Media App feature

  - List posts with a title and content with max length of 100 characters;
  - Each post can feature a user and how long ago the post was published;
  - User can see each post fully on a specific single page;
  - The user can also edit any post;
  - Each post can receive different reactions (like Slack).
